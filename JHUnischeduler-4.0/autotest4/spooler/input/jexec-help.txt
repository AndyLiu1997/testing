Usage: jexec [options]... <command> [args]...
Execute the given command on host list specified by the option '-m | --hosts='

Options and arguments:
  -u, --user                  specifies user to execute the command

  -t, --timeout               number of time in seconds. The application will wait remote 
                              works to return for the given period of time

  -m, --hosts                 specifies host list to run the command
                              if both -m and -e are not specified, the command will run on all hosts 

  -e, --host-expr             specifies expression for matching host
                              if both -m and -e are not specified, the command will run on all hosts 
                              all available metrics can be used in the expression 
                              to check available metrics for each host, run jhdshosts metrics <host_name|all>

                              the following operators are allowed:
                                '==' -- equals to, i.e. hostName == 'myhost' matches all hosts which name is 'myhost'
                                '~'  -- matches in regex way, i.e. hostName ~ 'my.*' matches all hosts which name starts with 'my'
                                '>'  -- great than, i.e. cpuUt > 0.8 matches all hosts which cpuUt > 0.8
                                '>=' -- great than or equals to, i.e. cpuUt >= 0.8 matches all hosts which cpuUt >= 0.8
                                '<'  -- less than, i.e. cpuUt < 0.8 matches all hosts which cpuUt < 0.8
                                '<=' -- less than or equals to, i.e. cpuUt <= 0.8 matches all hosts which cpuUt <= 0.8

  -l, --log-level             specifies logging level
                              optional levels are: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

  -h, --help                  display this help and exit

  -V, --version               display version information and exit
